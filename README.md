New Features
	Updated Settings page
	Added new settings to control the activation
	Added code to allow activation just by hovering
	Added ability to lock wing layout
	Added optional ClickThroughBlocker support (will use it if installed)
	Full TU support and metallic textures

If the setting "Use old keycode to activate" is not enabled, then moving the mouse over the wing part will activate the mod
There is a timer setting in the settings page which specifies how long the mod is activated after the mouse moves off of the wing.
Hovering the mouse over the window is the same as hovering over the wing, in regards to the timeout
Click anywhere outside the wing and window to deactivate it immediately
Use the new "Lock wing layout" option in the PAW to lock it down so it can't be changed
