# B9-PWings-Fork
Fork of Bac9's Procedural Wings mod for KSP

### This is my edit based on [@Jebman82](https://github.com/Rafterman82/B9-PWings-Fork)'s v1.00 B9PW
### Tested on KSP1.9.1 and KSP1.10.1

## New Feature ##
 1. 　Added handles for tweaking wing's shape
 2. 　Added numeric input for precise edit  
 3. 　It's now possible to create wings with offseted root, which allows all-moving wing's rotation hinge offseted
